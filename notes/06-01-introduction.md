# Functional manipulation

This lesson is all about FISH.

We'll revisit lambdas, and go a bit deeper, because they
are one of the essential specialties of Kotlin.

This leads to higher order functions - basically functions that
take functions as arguments.

This makes Kotlin extremely flexible.

We'll talk about SAM (single abstract methods), as well as inline.
