# SAM

SAM is an acronym for Single Abstract Method.

You'll run into SAM all the time in APIs written in the Java programming language.

Runnable and callable are 2 examples!

```kotlin
// Runnable has an abstract method "run"
// ie. needs to be implemented from the interface blueprint
interface Runnable {
  fun run()
}
```

```kotlin
interface Callable<T> {
  fun call(): T
}
```

Basically, SAM just means an interface with ONE method in it.
That's it!

In Kotlin we have to call functions that take SAM as parameters all the time.

STANDARD LIBRARY

Also a great way of finding out about the many features of Kotlin taht we did not have time to touch in this course.

Get to know the packages, extensions, and utilities of the Standard Library.

There's definitely so much more and it's best to learn as you need it.

The best way to become a Kotlin expert is through PRACTICE.
